Task-1 : Scanning Local Network for open ports.
Tools Used: Nmap, Wireshark, Command Prompt.
Procedure:
Step 1- Install Nmap application from Website "https://nmap.org/download"
Step 2- Open Command prompt and given cmd "ipconfig" to know the ipV4 address.
        Example: *.*.*.1/24
Step 3: Now open Nmap and type cmd " nmap -sS ipaddress/24 " to perform stealth scan for the range of ip given.
        Command: nmap -sS *.*.*.1/24
Step 4: After scanning the given ip address, we get to find information of number of ip address scanned and the ports opened with the service name for particular ip address.

Response Received from 256 ip addresses scanned: Nmap scan report for 192.168.0.1
Host is up (0.0077s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE    SERVICE
23/tcp   filtered telnet
80/tcp   open     http
1900/tcp open     upnp
MAC Address: 60:32:B1:9F:9D:B0 (TP-Link Technologies)

Step 5: Open Wireshark and capture the packet for which response was received with RST+ ACK for ipaddress.

Observation:
Found port open, wherein there will be a high chance for Sniffing of packets by the attacker and can perform Man-in-the-Middle attack as there is no encryption found for the particular ip mentioned.
