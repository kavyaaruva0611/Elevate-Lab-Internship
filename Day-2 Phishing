Task: Analyzing a phishing email sample.
Procedure:
Step 1: Copied the sample of phisphing email header from path given below:
      "https://github.com/rf-peixoto/phishing_pot/blob/main/email/sample-10.eml"
Step 2: Opened Chrome tab and search for MX Tool Box- Email Header Analyzer
Step 3: Copied header content and analyzed the data by pasting the content in Email Header Analyzer tool.
Step 4: Retrieved the ip address#89.144.44.2 of the sender and tried to run in cmd prompt using nslookup and ping cmd.
    Result:      Server:  UnKnown
                 Address:  2406:b400:8:1::2
*** UnKnown can't find 89.144.44.2: No response from server
Step 5: Searched for Virus Total and checked for the ip address

Important points to check in: 
SPF: Confirms sending IP is authorized for the domain.
DKIM: Verifies the emailâ€™s digital signature matches the domain.
DMARC: Enforces policies based on SPF and DKIM and provides reports
Return Path: Helps to know where the response is sent to
From and To address.

Observation:
1) As per checking found discrepancies between SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results. 
2) spf=none (sender IP is 89.144.44.2)- which is not reliable and authenticate
3) From address is shown as Microsoft account team ,_<no-reply@access-accsecurity.com> but the return path found was bounce@thcultarfdes.co.uk.
4) There must be atleast single DKIM signature, but there is no information found.
5) phishing@pot is found in the email sent header.

Prevention:
Do not click on any malicious link from email until SPF, DKIM signatures are verified by clicking on Original content.
Check whether there is spelling correction, ususal activity of spoofing the legitimate  email is done by changing the letter or font type of the email.
Check the subject line, if found malicious need to report as phisphing email.
Need to verify sender address and check its legitimacy.
